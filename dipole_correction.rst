Dipole correction in ONETEP
===========================

When the system has a net dipole, the electric field generated by it will incur
spurious interaction across periodic images, especially when there's not enough
vacuum space. The goal of applying dipole correction to ONETEP is to eliminate
this effect. An alternative way is to employ coulomb cut-off.

The net dipole moment :math:`\mu` can be easily calculated as,

.. math::

   \boldsymbol{\mu} = \int_\mathrm{cell} \rho(\mathbf{r}) \mathbf{r} d\mathbf{r}

where the total charge density $\rho(\mathbf{r})$ can be decomposed as the
contribution from the electrons and ions

.. math::

   \rho(\mathbf{r}) = -\rho_\mathrm{el}(\mathbf{r}) + \rho_\mathrm{ion}(\mathbf{r})

Correspondingly, the electric field created by this dipole moment can be
expressed as

.. math::

   E = 4\pi(\boldsymbol{\mu}/\Omega)_z

To eliminate this effect, we can insert a dipole layer (by directly manipulating
the external potential) along certain direction. This is done in the spirit of
`Jörg Neugebauer and Matthias Scheffler
<https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.46.16067>`__. 

For now, the dipole correction only supports slab calculation (or equivlant) and
can only be applied to the vacuum direction prependicular to the other two
directions. Note that you cell can be tilted but as long as the Cartesian
direction specified for the dipole correction is prependicular to the periodic
cell direction, the result is correct. The added electric field takes the
following shape

.. math::

   E = 4\pi(\boldsymbol{\mu}/\Omega)_z (z-z_\mathrm{origin})

Furthermore, one can add an external electric field by manipulating

.. math::

   \mu = \mu + \mu_\mathrm{ext}

and in this case, dipole correction could and should be added to make sure the
results are correct.

In ONETEP, dipole correction can be added by 

.. code::

   dipole_correction : T

and the correction direction is set by 

.. code::

   dipole_correction_dir : 3

The location of the dipole layer is set by 

.. code::

   efield_origin : 0.0 0.0 0.0

And a constant external electric field can be added as

.. code::

   constant_efield : 0.0 0.0 1.0
