Obtaining a copy of ONETEP
==========================

If you are an academic license user, you should have received a tarball of a
personalised ONETEP copy once you have signed an academic licence agreement.
Create a new directory, unpack the tarball there
(``tar -xfz your_tarball_name.tar.gz``), and you’re done. You can now go
straight to :ref:`starting_compiling`.

If you plan to have continuous access to the current ONETEP source code, likely
because you are a ONETEP developer or contributor, or collaborate with one, you
will want to have access to the official ONETEP GitHub repository.

 1. Take a look at :ref:`github_location` and :ref:`github_setup` to get
    acquainted with the overall set-up.
 2. If you don't have a GitHub account yet, follow the steps at
    :ref:`github_create` to create one.
 3. Then, create a GitHub *personal access token* by following the steps at
    :ref:`github_pat`. Without it you will not be able to access the repository
    due to GitHub policies (unless you already have a *PAT*).
 4. Follow :ref:`github_access` to get access. Be sure to follow
    further instuctions there, depending on whether you plan to be a *User*
    or a *Contributor*. Congratulations, you have your own copy of ONETEP!

Continue along to :ref:`starting_compiling`.


.. _starting_compiling:

Compiling, testing and running ONETEP
=====================================

These are the instructions for setting the environment prior to compiling ONETEP,
for how to compile ONETEP, and how to run quality-check (“QC”)
tests that will give you confidence in the robustness of your installation.
There are also instructions on how to actually submit (start) your jobs.

These instructions differ depending on your environment (the machine on which
you will run ONETEP and the installed software, such as compilers or external
libraries). **They are provided separately**.

  1. Go to the directory with your ONETEP installation.
  2. Change to the ``hpc_resources`` directory. There you will see a number of
     well-supported systems, such as ``Archer2`` or ``Young`` (and more).
  3. If your machine is well-supported by ONETEP, just follow the compilation,
     testing and running instructions there. For instance, instructions for
     Iridis5 would be found at hpc_resources/Iridis5/instructions_iridis5.pdf.

     If your machine is not in the list of well-supported systems, you will need
     to adapt one of the existing configs. Look into the subdirectories under
     ``hpc_resources`` and also in the ``config`` directory in your ONETEP
     installation.

**Important point about compiling ONETEP following a git merge**:

.. warning:: If you just updated your ONETEP source via ``git merge`` or ``git pull``
    (rather than cloning via ``git clone`` or unpacking ONETEP from a tarball),
    issue a ``make cleanall`` before compiling. The script for cascade avoidance
    used when making ONETEP can get confused as to what needs to be rebuilt after a
    ``git merge`` or ``git pull``. If you forget about ``make cleanall``, you
    may get an executable that builds correctly but malfunctions in strange ways
    (usually producing very unexpected error messages).

**Important point about running QC tests**:

.. warning:: Never run the QC tests in the actual repository. Create a copy of your
    ONETEP installation directory (e.g. ``cp -a onetep_jd onetep_jd_qc``) and
    run the tests in the directory of the copy. Much of the stuff in the install
    is not needed to run the tests (e.g. all of ``src/``), but it's just less
    hassle to copy the entire thing than pick out the necessary subdirectories.

    Why not run the QC tests in the actual repository? Because they produce
    outputs, which can become messy to clean up back to pristine state,
    polluting your repository with spurious changes. This becomes more
    problematic because symbolic links are used in the QC test suite. Trying
    to update your repository via ``git pull`` or ``git fetch`` may be
    tricky when you have unfinished or improperly cleaned up QC tests. Just
    don't run them straight in the repository.


Creating input files
====================

Go to the ONETEP website, `onetep.org <onetep.org>`__. There, under *Resources*
you will find the *Tutorials* section, which introduces running various kinds of
ONETEP calculations. Take a look at some of the input files at the
bottom of the page. Input files in ONETEP have the ``.dat`` file
extension. Should any files get downloaded having a ``.txt`` extension,
you will need to rename them to end with ``.dat``.

Input files contain keywords, instructing ONETEP on what calculations to
run, and to set the parameters needed to run them. Check out the
keywords on the webpage
`onetep.org/Main/Keywords <onetep.org/Main/Keywords>`__ to see what they
mean. If not specified, most of them have default settings, as listed on
the webpage.

The keywords come in different types: ``logical``, ``integer``,
``real``, ``text``, ``physical`` and ``block``. Keywords of the type
``logical`` can have a value of ``T`` (true) or ``F`` (false).
Keywords that are ``integer`` and ``real`` are numbers. Keywords of
type ``text`` are a string of characters (for example a filename).
Keywords of the type ``physical`` refer to physical variables, which
come with units such as angstroem, bohr, joule, hartree, etc. A
``block`` indicates more than one line of input, these are often used
for specifying coordinates.

Some of the important keywords to get started are:

-  ``task`` – to choose what main calculation you would like ONETEP to
   perform, e.g. a single point energy calculation or geometry
   optimisation. You can run a properties calculation this way, using
   output files generated from a single point energy calculation or
   using ``task singlepoint`` and a separate keyword ``do_properties``
   set to ``T``.

-  ``xc_functional`` – to choose how to approximate the
   exchange-correlation term in the Kohn Sham DFT energy expression.

-  ``%block lattice_cart`` – to define the dimensions of the simulation
   cell.

-  ``%block positions_abs`` – to define the atomic positions in
   Cartesian coordinates.

As can be seen from the example input files, all ``block`` keywords must
end with a corresponding ``endblock``. Be default all coordinates are in
atomic units (bohr). To switch to angstroems, add ``ang`` in the first
line of the block:

| ``%block positions_abs``
| ``ang``
| ``C 16.521413 15.320039 23.535776``
| ``O 16.498729 15.308934 24.717249``
| ...
| ``%endblock positions_abs``

The ``species`` and ``species_pot`` blocks detail the parameters of the
atoms. Non-orthogonal Generalised Wannier Functions (NGWFs) are used to
model the atomic orbitals. In the ``species`` block, the name we give to
each type atom in the system is given first, followed by the element of
the atom, its atomic number, the number of NGWFs to use (use -1 for an
educated guess) and the radius of each NGWF typically around 8.0-10.0
(in bohr) for an accurate calculation. For instance for carbon you might
use:

``C C 6 4 8.0``

The ``species_pot`` block specifies the location of the pseudopotential
used for each element of the system. The standard ONETEP norm-conserving
pseudopotentials (``.recpot`` files) exclude core electrons. Core
electrons are included in ``.paw`` files. Some of these can be found in
your repository’s ``pseudo`` directory. A complete database of all
pseudopotentials for all elements in the ``.paw`` format can be
downloaded from
https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/gbrv/all_pbe_paw_v1.5.tar.gz. There are also
PAWs and pseudopotential (``.recpot``) files in the ``utils-devel``
repository at https://github.com/onetep-devel/utils-devel.

ONETEP also supports pseudopotentials in the UPF format (``.upf``), either
norm-conserving (NC) or projector augmented wave (PAW).
Popular repositories for pseudopotentials in this format can be found at
`PseudoDojo <https://www.pseudo-dojo.org>`__ and
`Standard Solid State Pseudopotentials <https://www.materialscloud.org/discover/sssp/table/efficiency>`__.


.. _restarting_onetep:

Restarting or continuing ONETEP runs
====================================

ONETEP can write several files that can be reused to either continue a
task or to perform subsequent tasks that are compatible with the
one that has completed. For example, a task might not have achieved the
desired precision in the total energy and has to be restarted with new
parameters. As another example, the geometry of some complicated system
was optimised and the next task is to compute something else based on
the optimised atomic positions and/or cell parameters. When doing this
it's important not to change the name of the input file between ONETEP
runs, as the names of these auxiliary files are derived from the name of
the input file and ONETEP will not be able to find them and read them
otherwise.

The auxiliary files are written if the corresponding keywords in the
input file have been activated. These keywords are generally of the
form ``write_[...] T`` and must be present in the input file used for
the task that has completed. To instruct ONETEP to read these files for
a subsequent task the respective keywords ``read_[...] T`` have to be
added to the input file. If these keywords are present in the input file
but the respective files do not exist or are not present in the folder
where ONETEP is running the run will abort with an error.  Which files
can be written depends on the task, but there are some files that are
common to most tasks. The file containing the NGWFs is written using
``write_tightbox_ngwfs T``. In addition, the density kernel can be
written using ``write_denskern T``, and in DFT calculations with
fractional occupation numbers (EDFT) one can also write out the
Hamiltonian with ``write_hamiltonian T``. In a follow-up run these
files are then read by setting ``read_tightbox_ngwfs T``,
``read_denskern T`` and ``read_hamiltonian T`` as appropriate. The
density kernel and the Hamiltonian are derived from the NGWFs, so
reading the respective auxiliary files without reading the NGWFs is
of no practical benefit.

ONETEP can automate the logic explained in the previous paragraph to
save the user the trouble of having to change/add all the appropriate
flags to the input file, using ``task restart``. The fundamental
condition for this to work is for the previous task to have completed
correctly. If the simulation crashed or ran out of computing time then
there is no guarantee that the files needed for continuation or restart
have been written correctly and attempting a restart will fail with an
error.  For example, to continue a singlepoint run that was declared in
the input file with ``task singlepoint`` one prepends the restart task
to the task list: ``task restart singlepoint``. ONETEP should then be
executed on the same folder that was used for the previous task (or on
a full copy of this folder). This will trigger some internal heuristics
on what can be done based on what files are available from the prior run,
using the information logged in its XML file (if the input file was named
``something.dat`` then the XML file is named ``something.xml``). If the
appropriate files are present in the folder for the new run then the
corresponding flags are activated: ``read_[...] = T``. As an additional
simplification to the user, if the prior run has resulted in an optimised
geometry and/or cell parameters, this is also automatically updated
using the XML file when using ``task restart``.

Certain tasks have more specific continuation mechanisms which are
described in their respective documentation. These are:

* Calculations with solvent: :ref:`solvation_auto`
  and :ref:`solvation_manual`

.. _running_parallel:

Running ONETEP in parallel environments
=======================================

ONETEP is typically run on more than one CPU core – whether on a desktop
computer, or at a high-performance computing (HPC) facility. This is
termed *parallel operation*. There are two main modes of parallel
operation – *distributed-memory* computing (sometimes termed simply
*parallelism*), and *shared-memory* computing (sometimes termed
*concurrency*). ONETEP combines both of them, so it will be crucial to
understand how they work.

Distributed-memory parallelism (MPI)
------------------------------------

In this scenario a collection of individual *processes* (that is,
running instances of a program) work together on the same calculation.
The processes can all reside on the same physical machine (often termed
*node*) – e.g. when you run them on your many-core desktop machine – or
on separate machines (nodes) – e.g. when you run them at an HPC
facility.

In both cases processes reside in separate memory spaces, which is a
fancy way of saying they *do not share* memory – each of them gets a
chunk of memory and they don’t know what the other processes have in
their chunks. Yes, even when they are on the same machine.

The problem they work on has to be somehow subdivided between them –
this is known as *parallel decomposition*. One common way of doing that
– and one that ONETEP employs – is *data decomposition*, where it’s the
data in the problem that is subdivided across processes. In ONETEP the
grids on which quantities like electronic density or external potential
are calculated are divided across processes, with each process “owning”
a slab of the grid. Similarly, the atoms in the system are divided
across processes, with each process “owning” a subset of atoms. Both of
these concepts are illustrated in :numref:`MPI`.

From the point of view of the operating system, the processes running on
a machine are separate entities (see :numref:`processes`), and
collaboration between them almost always necessitates some form of
communication (because, remember, they do not share memory) – e.g.
process #1 may need to ask process #2 “what are the positions of *your*
atoms?” This is accomplished by a dedicated software library known as
Message Passing Interface (MPI). This is why we often call the processes
*MPI processes*, or, more technically, *MPI ranks*.

   Four ONETEP processes running on one machine, each utilising 100% of a CPU core and 0.4% of available memory.

MPI facilitates starting multiple processes as part of a single
calculation, which can become slightly tricky when there are multiple
machines (nodes) involved. Your MPI installation will provide a
dedicated command for running multiple processes. The command is often
called ``mpirun``, ``aprun``, ``gerun``, ``srun`` or something similar
(it will certainly be stated in the documentation for your system). On a
desktop machine its invocation typically looks like this:

``mpirun -np 4 ./onetep_launcher input.dat >input.out 2>input.err``

Here, ``mpirun`` is the name of the command for launching multiple
processes, ``-np 4`` asks for four processes, ``onetep_launcher`` is the name of
the script for launching ONETEP – it’s the script that will actually be
run on four CPU cores, and each instance will start one ONETEP process
for you – here we assume it’s in the current directory (``./``),
``input.dat`` is your ONETEP input file. Output will be sent
(“redirected”) to ``onetep.out``, and error messages (if any), will be
redirected to ``input.err``. All four processes will be started on the
same machine.

In HPC environments the syntax will be slightly different, because the
number of processes will be automatically inferred by the batch
(queueing) system, the batch system will also take care of instructing
``mpirun`` (or equivalent) what machines to put the processes on.

MPI lets you run your calculation on as many processes as you like –
even tens of thousands. However, there are practical limitations to how
far you can go with ONETEP. Looking at :numref:`MPI` it becomes clear
that you cannot have more MPI processes than atoms – or some processes
would be left without work to do. In fact this limitation is even
slightly stricter – to divide work more evenly ONETEP tries to give each
processes a similar number of NGWFs, not atoms. For instance, for a
water molecule run on two processes, it makes sense to assign the O atom
and its 4 NGWFs to one process, and both H atoms (1 NGWF each) to the
second process. If you try to run a calculation on H:sub:`2`O on *three* processes,
it’s very likely that ONETEP will do the same thing – assign O to one
processes, both H’s to another process and the third process will wind
up with no atoms. This will cause the calculation to abort. So, one
limitation is **you will not be able to use more MPI processes that you
have atoms in your system, and even slightly smaller numbers of MPI
processes might not work**. Even if they do, you don’t really want that,
because load balancing will be rather poor – the processor that gets the
O atom has roughly twice as much work to do as the one that gets the two
H atoms. The bottom line is – *you should have at least several atoms
per MPI rank* – in the interest of efficiency.

Shared-memory parallelism (OMP)
-------------------------------

This approach, sometimes known as *concurrency*, *concurrent processing*
or colloquially as *threads*, uses *shared memory*. The way it works is
a process *spawns* (starts) a number of *threads of execution*, with
each thread delegated to a separate CPU core. Typically each thread
works with a subset of data, and, in contrast to processes, threads
within the same process can access each other’s memory. For example, if
a process was given 50 atoms to work with, it can spawn 4 threads and
tell each thread to work on 12-13 atoms. Because threads share memory,
they do not need special mechanisms to communicate – they can just use
memory for this. What they need instead are special mechanisms for
synchronisation – e.g. so that thread 1 knows thread 2 finished writing
something to memory and it’s safe to try to read it. These mechanisms
are described by a standard known as ``OpenMP``, or ``OMP`` for short.

In ONETEP threads are most conveniently handled using the launcher’s
``-t`` option, which instructs it how many threads each process should
spawn. For instance the command

``./onetep_launcher -t 8 input.dat >input.out 2>input.err``

runs one process (note the absence of ``mpirun``), which spawns eight
threads. This is what it looks like to the operating system:

.. _Figure fig:starting_with_onetep_fig3:
.. figure:: _static/resources/starting_with_onetep_fig3.png
   :target: _static/resources/starting_with_onetep_fig3.png
   :alt: One ONETEP process that spawned eight threads, running on one machine, utilising almost 800% of a CPU core and 1.3% of available memory – this is for the entire process encompassing eight threads.

   One ONETEP process that spawned eight threads, running on one machine, utilising almost 800% of a CPU core and 1.3% of available memory – this is for the entire process encompassing eight threads.

Thread-based processing has a number of limitations. As threads reside
within a process, you cannot feasibly run more threads than you have CPU
cores on a node – in other words, threading is limited to a single node.
Moreover, large numbers of threads quickly become inefficient. If a
processes owns 10 atoms, using more than 10 threads will not give you
any advantage, because the additional threads will not have anything to
work with (fortunately, this does not lead to the calculation aborting,
only to some threads idling). Even with four threads you will lose some
efficiency, because some threads will get 3 atoms and some only 2.
ONETEP works best with about 4-6 threads, unless you are using
Hartree-Fock exchange (HFx), which is the most efficient on large thread
counts.

Threads are easiest to control via ``onetep_launcher``, which you are
advised to use, but ONETEP also provides keywords for controlling them
manually – these are ``threads_max``, ``threads_per_fftbox``,
``threads_num_fftboxes``, ``threads_per_cellfft`` and
``threads_num_mkl``. Each of these sets the number of threads spawned
from a single process for some part of ONETEP\ ’s functionality. This is
advanced stuff and will not be covered in this beginners’ document.

Another point to note is that each thread requires its own *stack* (a
region of memory for intermediate data) in addition to the global
(per-process) stack. This per-thread stack needs to be large enough –
almost always 64 MB suffices. So, if you spawn 16 threads from a
process, that’s an extra 1024 MB of memory that you need, per process.
If you use ``onetep_launcher``, it takes care of setting this stack for
you. If you don’t – you’ll need to take care of this on your own (by
exporting a suitable ``OMP_STACKSIZE``) or you risk ugly crashes when
the stack runs out. Not recommended.

Hybrid (combined MPI+OMP) parallelism
-------------------------------------

For anything but the smallest of systems, combining MPI processes with
OMP threads is the most efficient approach. This is known as *hybrid
parallelism*. In ONETEP this is realised simply by combining ``mpirun``
(or equivalent) with ``onetep_launcher``\ ’s ``-t`` option, like this:

``mpirun -np 4 ./onetep_launcher -t 8 input.dat >input.out 2>input.err``

Here we are starting 4 processes, each of which spawns 8 threads. This
set-up would fully saturate a large, 32-core desktop machine.

Setting up processes and threads looks slightly different in HPC
systems, where you need to start them on separate nodes. Your submission
script (you will find ones for common architectures in the
``hpc_resources`` directory of your ONETEP installation) defines all the
parameters at the top of the script and then accordingly invokes
``mpirun`` (or equivalent) and ``onetep_launcher``. Look at the
beginning of the script to see what I mean.

How many nodes, processes and threads should I use?
---------------------------------------------------

There are a few points worth considering here. First of all, efficiency
almost universally decreases with the number of CPU cores assigned to a
problem. That is to say, throwing 100 cores at a problem is likely to
reduce the time to solution by less than 100-fold. This is because of
communication overheads, load imbalance and small sections of the
algorithm that remain sequential, and is formally known as `Amdahl’s
law <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law>`__. It’s worth
keeping this in mind if you have a large number of calculations to
perform (known as *task farming*) – if you have 1000 calculations to
perform, and have 500 CPU cores at your disposal, time to solution will
be the shortest if you run 500 1-core jobs first, followed by 500 1-core
jobs next. If you opt for running a job on 500 CPU cores simultaneously,
and do this for 1000 jobs in sequence, your time to solution will be
much, much worse, because of efficiency diminishing with the number of
cores.

Having said that, task farming is not the only scenario in the world.
Sometimes you have few jobs, or only one, that you want to run quickly.
Here, you’re not overly worried about efficiency – if running the job on
1 CPU core takes a month, and using 100 CPU cores reduces it to a day,
you’d still take 100 CPU cores, or even more. You just have to remember
that the returns will be diminishing with each CPU core you add [1]_.

The remaining points can be summarised as follows:

#. Avoid using 1-2 atoms per MPI process, unless there’s no other way.
   Try to have at least several atoms per MPI process – for good
   load-balancing.

#. For OMP threads the sweet spot is typically 4-5 threads. If you have
   a giant system, so that you have a hundred atoms or more per MPI
   process, you might be better off using 2 threads or even 1 (using
   purely distributed-memory parallelism). This is because load
   balancing will be very good with high numbers of atoms per MPI
   process. If you have a small system, or if already using large
   numbers of MPI processes, so that you wind up with very few atoms per
   MPI process (say, below 5), you might find that using higher numbers
   of threads (say, 8) to reduce the number of MPI processes is
   beneficial.

#. Know how many CPU cores you have on a node. Make sure the number of
   MPI processes *per node* and OMP threads per process saturate all the
   node’s cores. For instance, if you have 40 CPU cores on a node, you
   should aim for 10 processes per node, 4 threads each; or 20 processes
   per node, 2 threads each; or 40 processes per node, 1 thread each; or
   4 processes per node, 10 threads each. 2 processes per node with 20
   threads each would also work, but would likely be suboptimal. Just
   don’t do things like 3 processes with 10 threads, because then you
   leave 10 CPU cores idle, and don’t do things like 6 processes with 10
   threads, because you then oversubscribe the node (meaning you have
   more threads than CPU cores) – this degrades performance.

#. Nodes are often divided internally into *NUMA regions* – most often
   there are two NUMA regions per node. The only thing you need to know
   about NUMA regions is that you don’t want a process to span across
   them. This is why in the example above you did not see 5 processes
   with 8 OMP threads each or 8 processes with 5 OMP threads each – I
   assumed there are two NUMA regions with 20 CPU cores each. In both
   examples here you would have a process spanning across two NUMA
   regions. It works, but is much slower.

#. Points 1-3 above do not apply to Hartree-Fock exchange calculations.
   Point 4 applies. When doing HFx calculations (this includes
   calculations with hybrid exchange-correlation functionals, like
   B3LYP) follow the more detailed instructions in the HFx manual.

#. If you find that your calculation is running out of memory, your
   first step should be to increase the number of nodes (because it
   splits the problem across a set-up with more total RAM). Another idea
   is to shift the MPI/OMP balance towards more threads and fewer MPI
   processes (because this reduces the number of buffers for
   communication between MPI processes). So if your job runs out of
   memory on 2 nodes with 10 processes on each and with 4 threads per
   process, give it 4 or more nodes with 10 processes on each with 4
   threads per each, or switch to 4 processes with 10 OMP threads.
